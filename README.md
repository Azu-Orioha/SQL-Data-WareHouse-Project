# SQL-Data-WareHouse-Project

# PHASE 1

## OBJECTIVE :
This project aims to develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data from multiple sources. The solution will facilitate analytical reporting and support informed decision-making by providing a unified data model optimized for complex queries and analysis.

## SPECIFICATION:
 Data Source: 
 Import and consolidate data from two primary source systems—Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM)—provided as CSV files.
 
 Data Quality: 
 Cleanse and resolve data quality issues to ensure accuracy and reliability prior to analysis.
 
 Integration: 
 Design and implement a user-friendly data model that integrates both sources, facilitating efficient analytical queries.
 
 
  
## SCOPE
The focus will be on the most recent datasets to ensure relevance and applicability of the analytical insights. Historical data may be considered if it adds significant value to the analysis.

## DOCUMENTATION
Comprehensive documentation will be provided, including:​

Data Dictionary: Detailed descriptions of all tables, columns, data types, and relationships.​

Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs): Visual representations of the data model to aid understanding.​

Process Documentation: Step-by-step guides on data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL) processes, and analytical query examples.

# PHASE 2

## OBJECTIVE :
 Develop SQL based analytics to deliver detailed insights into 
 (1) Customer behaviour
 (2) Product performance
 (3) Sales trends.




## TECHNOLOGIES USED 

SQL Server: Database management system for data storage and querying.​
